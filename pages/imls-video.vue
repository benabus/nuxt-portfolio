        <nuxt-link to="/cadre">The CADRE project</nuxt-link> is funded by a grant from the IMLS.  In applying for the grant, it was decided by the PIs that we needed an eye-catching introduction video to easily explain the problem we were trying to solve and the proposed solution.  At the time, IUNI had limited resources and it fell upon the <a href="https://iuni.iu.edu/about/people/staff" class="_blank">IUNI IT Team</a> to figure something out before the grant submission deadline less than a week away.

        After a short brainstorming session, I came up with the idea to create a "whiteboard" animation because it could be done relatively quickly with off-the-shelf software.  Because it was my idea and I was the only one of us with experience in illustration, I was volunteered to create the visuals for the video.  The script was written as a collaboration between the PIs and our data manager.  The narration was recorded by our data manager because he has a British accent.  After being given the audio recording, I created the illustrations by hand, traced them into Adobe Illustrator, and imported the Illustrator files into a whiteboard animation creation software.

        To reiterate, this process was completed in under a week by a couple of IT professionals.  Thankfully, the work was not in vain.  It is widely believed that this video was a primary contributing factor to the success of our grant proposal.
