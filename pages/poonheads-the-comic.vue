        <p>The year was 2004. A year out of high school, I was a care free college student. Still living at home. Still getting into mischief high school friends. Spending a lot of time online.</p>

        <p>And that's when I discovered that you didn't have to be good to be a successful web comicker. My life long dream of being a comic artist could actually be a reality. So, I wrote a few strips based on a screen play that my friends and I had been working on, built a rudimentary web page and threw them online.</p>

        <p>For a little more than a year (60 strips in total), I updated the website weekly with new comics. By web comic standards of the time, this was an eternity. I made over the website several times, each time with a more robust, custom CMS built for managing web comics. I worked just as hard on this side project as I did my course work (perhaps even more so).</p>

        <p>With each week, my artistic skills grew, the insanity and scope of the stories heightened, and each strip required more effort. I would work on the strips to the detriment of other aspects of life. Eventually, school would catch up to me and I burned out. Poonheads would be no more.</p>

        <p>Some time later, as college began to wind down and I found more and more spare time, I decided to relaunch Poonheads, updating the site less frequently with higher quality work. I enjoyed, and still do, making comic strips, but I like doing it for fun. There's no need for a hobby to become a chore. Sure, it's possible to make a living off of web comicking, but it's really not for me.</p>

        <p>Years later, my web hosting was canceled and Poonheads had effectively disappeared from the web. Since I needed to put the comics somewhere, and tumblr was the new hotness at the time, I started and account uploaded all the old content there. I created a custom theme based on the design of the original website and forwarded the domain. The archive, in addition to a bunch of extra content including sketches, flyers, and a new comic I created for the 10th anniversary, can be found there.</p>
