        This book is a result of an assignment in an instructional design
        course. The assignment was to create a fully illustrated booklet of no
        less than 16 pages. As both a programmer and an illustrator, I decided
        to merge the two to create a basic primer explaining the basics of
        computer programming using lengthy illustrations instead of lengthy
        paragraphs.

        Needless to say, programming cannot be explained in 16 pages. It soon
        ballooned out of control to about 100 pages.

        I would consider this book only 'volume 1' in a series. The deadline
        approached before I could go into more advanced topics. I hope to
        eventually either complete this book or create a volume 2 which would
        cover the topics I couldn't get to in volume 1. Additionally, I'd like
        to find a printer or publisher that doesn't cost an arm and a leg to
        publish a full color book like this.
