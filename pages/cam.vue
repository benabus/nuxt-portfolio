                The Conference Agenda Manager (CAM) is a system that allows conference administrators to provide attendees with a searchable and easily updateable database of events and presentations that will occur during a conference. Attendees are then able to anonymously edit, view, and share customized agendas featuring only the events that they desire to attend, all without having to register a new account that will only be used for the few weeks before and during the conference.

            CAM was built at IUNI for NetSci 2017, and then used again for NetSci 2018.

            The front-end was built using Quasar with the intention of compiling it into a native mobile app.  Backend is PHP and MySQL, chosen based on the technology available on the server.
